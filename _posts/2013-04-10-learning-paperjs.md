title: Learning paper.js
---

While working on a user interface to visualize the topography of solar
installations I got to work with the html canvas element and the
[paper.js](http://paperjs.org/about/) library. As an exercise to become
more familiar with the library I decided to give a presentation on it to
the [Burlington JS](http://burlingtonjs.org/2013/04/10/launch.html) group.

The idea was to build a presentation app similar to prezi where slides are
mapped out on a large canvas and the viewport moves around to transition
from one to the next. There is already a nicely featured javascript library
called [impress.js](http://impress.github.io/impress.js) so I decided to
call my much more basic version [underwhelm](https://github.com/ianmetcalf/underwhelm).

Once the basic app was built I created a simple presentation with it that
covered what went into making the app, the features of the libraries used
and some of the issues that I encountered. While a little gimicky, it was
a fun oppertunity to share an interesting technology to a group of like
minded folks.
